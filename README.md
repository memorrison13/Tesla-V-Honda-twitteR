# Tesla-V-Honda-twitteR
The following code looks at what Twitter users are saying about Tesla and Honda

Being in the Automotive Industry, there is a lot of talk about Tesla. 
Everyone is fascinated by them and is watching their every move. 
I wanted to see how similar (or dissimilar) Tesla is to Honda (one of the largest automotive brands).
In order to do so, I decided to scrape Twitter with R. In R, the twitteR package is used. 
First, a connection through the API needs to be made so that the user can access people's tweets. 
Once the connection is made, the user can pull tweets using certain key phrases or words. 
I pulled tweets for both Tesla and Honda, then made a word cloud to see what is being said about both brands.
